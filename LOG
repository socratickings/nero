    Woke up and while still in a daze opened Twitter. Closed as soon as I
    realized. But this is a great example I broke for two days and now momentum
    is working against me not for me. Time to keep pushing.

    completely broke again for the same reason. But have gotten it out my
    system and am ready to get back on the grind. Also did not break my most important
    goal of avoiding x.

    - y: cycled 30 mins , avg 78W
    - t: This morning I didn't want to go to jits. My body energy low
    physiologically and probably placebo from last night busting a nut with the woman.

    After remembering that the deal has already been made, a light switch went off.
    What good is a man's word when it's not even good to himself?
